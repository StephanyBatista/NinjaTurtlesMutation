# NinjaTurtlesMutation

If you're not familiar with what is mutation testing, [this article](http://www.codeaffine.com/2015/10/05/what-the-heck-is-mutation-testing/) give a good explanation on the
java case.

NinjaTurtlesMutation [is a fork](#differences-with-ninjaturtles) of [NinjaTurtles](http://ninjaturtles.codeplex.com/). It aims to provide a fast mutation testing tool for
codebases using NUnit v2.6.4.




NTM is fast and generate easy to read reports of mutation coverage:

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2010+. It's recommended that you have NuGet installed.
- .NET Framework v4.5+

## Installation

**The followings steps assume that you are using a sh-like terminal**

#### Clone the repository

`git clone git@github.com:criteo/NinjaTurtlesMutation.git`

#### Build NinjaTurtlesMutation

To build from command-line (tested with MSBuild 4.6.1 / .NET 4.0.3):

`/c/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v4.0.30319/MSBuild.exe NinjaTurtlesMutation.sln`

*or you can open the NinjaTurtlesMutation.sln and build from Visual Studio*

#### Set the PATH to the executable

`export PATH=$PATH:"path/to/your/clone/NinjaTurtlesMutation.Console/bin/Debug"`

## Usage

To illustrate basic usages, I'll use a dummy solution with two projects. One for the library,
one for the tests

*You can find this demo project inside Demofiles/PrimeFinderMutationPlayground*

    | PrimeFinderMutationPlayground
        | PrimeFinderMutationPlayground.IDummy
        | PrimeFinderMutationPlayground.Dummy
        | PrimeFinderMutationPlayground.PrimeFinder
    | PrimeFinder.UTest
        | PrimeFinder.UTest.T_PrimeMutationPlayground

The library has one namespace (`PrimeFinderMutationPlayground`) with three classes. The test
library has one namespace (`PrimeFinder.UTest`) with one class.
When built, this solution generates two dlls: PrimeFinderMutationPlayground.dll and PrimeFinder.UTest.dll

#### Test a class

`ntm.exe run -c PrimeFinderMutationPlayground.PrimeFinder path/to/test/assembly/PrimeFinder.UTest.dll`

This command start a mutation test on all the methods contained in the PrimeFinder class.
During his progress, NTM displays the full name of each method tested.
This output the following:

Mutation score: 0,88 (77 / 88)
Mutation testing failed
```

**TL;DR:** *From bottom to top, you can find the result of the mutation test (fail/success),
the mutation score, details about the surviving mutants, and the methods that NTM has tested.*

At the bottom, NTM displays the mutation score (0.88): which is the ratio mutants killed over
mutants generated *(77 / 88)*. The higher the better, capping at 1.

Above the mutation score, the surviving mutants are described. The listing is sorted by files, lines
and then mutation type. The number in parenthesis is the number of mutants generated by this kind of
mutation operator, at this line. For each of those mutants, the details of the IL modifications is
printed.

And then on top of the surviving mutants list, NTM displayed the methods tested. Here we can see
that 3 methods were found inside the PrimeFinder class.

#### Test all classes in a namespace

`ntm.exe run -N PrimeFinderMutationPlayground path/to/test/assembly/PrimeFinder.UTest.dll`

This command start a mutation test on all the methods, of every classes contained in the 
PrimeFinderMutationPlayground namespace.
The output is like the "class mode" described in the previous section, except it cover more methods:

Mutation score: 0,88 (77 / 88)

```

#### Generate a file report

You can generate two kind of reports: XML and HTML.

They both contain the path and code of the original source files, the mutated lines listing, and
which one survived.

The html file is built from the xml. So some of the informations can only be found in the xml report.
These informations include the start/end lines/columns of the mutations (a mutation can span on
several line), and details of IL changes made for each mutants, even the one that has been killed.

##### I want the xml report !

Use the `--output [-o]` option, and give a filename with it. It should look like this:

`ntm.exe run -o mutation_report.xml -N PrimeFinderMutationPlayground PrimeFinder.UTest.dll`

![Xml Output](Demofiles/XmlOutput.png?raw=true)

##### I want the html report !

Like the xml report use `--output [-o]` to specify a filename and set the format with the `--format [-f]`
option as follow:

`ntm.exe run -o mutation_report.html -f HTML -N PrimeFinderMutationPlayground PrimeFinder.UTest.dll`

![Html Output](Demofiles/HtmlOutput.png?raw=true)

## Differences with NinjaTurtles

- Only compatible with tests made with NUnit (2.6.2 to 2.6.4)
- Have a namespace mode to test several classes at once
- Report of surviving mutants in the console output
- Tests run are completely separated from the NTM application. A dispatching process exchange tests
  queries/results with NTM. The dispatcher also handle the workload between several test runner
  processes
- A NUnit.Core.RemoteTestRunner instance run the tests (no longer a nunit-console process)
- Benchmark mutant's tests set to detect infinite loop quicker
- Better handling of methods with generic parameters
- The HTML report include details about mutated line that survive
- Use symlink instead of file copy for non-mutated assembly
- Stability improvement
