NinjaTurtlesMutation is a fork of [NinjaTurtles]. It aim to provide a fast mutation testing tool for

*For the sake of simplicity, the followings steps assume that you are using a sh-like terminal*

###Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/TonyRoussel/NinjaTurtlesMutation.git`

**Download/clone the repository** wherever you want. Just keep in mind that the executable you'll use
will be located in path/to/your/clone/NinjaTurtles.Console/bin/Debug

###Set the PATH to the executable

`export PATH=$PATH:"path/to/your/clone/NinjaTurtles.Console/bin/Debug"`

###Build NinjaTurtlesMutation

From the repo's root, **open NinjaTurtlesMutation.sln and hit F6** to build NTM with the test
assembly. *If you doesn't want to build the test, in the Solution Explorer select all the projects
except NinjaTurtles.Tests and hit Shift + F6*

At this point everything is ready. In NinjaTurtles.Console/bin/Debug, you should have 3 executables:
