NinjaTurtlesMutation
====================

NinjaTurtlesMutation is a fork of NinjaTurtles. It aim to provide a fast mutation testing tool for
codebases using NUnit v2.6.4 as their unit test framework.

Prerequisites
=============

- Visual Studio 2010+. It's recommended that you have NuGet and JetBrains ReSharper 6+ installed.
- .NET Framework v4.5+

Installing
==========

For the sake of simplicity, the followings steps assume that you are using a sh-like terminal

Clone the repository
--------------------

git clone https://github.com/TonyRoussel/NinjaTurtlesMutation.git

Download/clone the repository wherever you want. Just keep in mind that the executable you'll use
will be located in path/to/your/clone/NinjaTurtles.Console/bin/Debug

Set the PATH to the executable
------------------------------

export PATH=$PATH:"path/to/your/clone/NinjaTurtles.Console/bin/Debug"

Build NinjaTurtlesMutation
--------------------------

From the repo's root, open NinjaTurtlesMutation.sln and hit F6 to build NTM with the test
assembly.
If you doesn't want to build the test, in the Solution Explorer select all the projects
except NinjaTurtles.Tests and hit Shift + F6

At this point everything is ready. In NinjaTurtles.Console/bin/Debug, you should have 3 executables:
- NinjaTurtles.Console.exe
- testdispatcher.exe
- testrunner.exe

Usage

Differences with NinjaTurtles
=============================

- Only compatible with tests made with NUnit (v2.6.4)
- Have a namespace mode to tests several classes at once
- Display a report of surviving mutants at the end of the console output
- Tests run are completely separated from the NTM application. A dispatching process exchange tests
  queries/results with NTM. The dispatcher also handle the workload between several test runner
  processes
- A NUnit.Core.RemoteTestRunner instance run the tests (no longer a nunit-console process)
- Benchmark mutant's tests set to detect infinite loop quicker
- Better handling of methods with generic parameters
- The HTML report now include details about mutated line that survive
- Use symlink instead of file copy for non-mutated assembly
- Stability improvement
